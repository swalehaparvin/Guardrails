        "\n",
        "This notebook shows how we can use LlamaGuardModeratorPack to safeguard the LLM inputs and outputs of a RAG pipeline using [Llama Guard](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b).  The RAG pipeline uses the following models:\n",
        "\n",
        "* LLMs: `zephyr-7b-beta` for response synthesizing; `LlamaGuard-7b` for input/output moderation\n",
        "* Embedding model: `UAE-Large-V1`\n",
        "\n",
        "We experiment with Llama Guard to moderate user input and LLM output data through two scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The default taxonomy for the unsafe categories which comes with Llama Guard's release.\n",
        "* Custom taxonomy for the unsafe categories.  In addition to the the original 6 unsafe categories, we added a \"07\" category for sensitive financial data, and a \"08\" category for prompt injection attempts, both are for testing purpose only. You can modify any existing category or add new ones based on your particular requirements.  \n",
        "\n",
        "We observe how Llama Guard is able to successfully moderate the LLM input and output of the RAG pipeline, and produce the desired final response to the end user.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Please note this notebook requires hardware, I ran into OutOfMemory issue with T4 high RAM, V100 high RAM is on the boarderline, may or may not run into memory issue depending on demands.  A100 worked well, but even with Colab pro+, it's not consistently available due to high demands.*"
