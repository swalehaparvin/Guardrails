#🚦 LLM Guardrails: Colab Notebooks

This repository provides Google Colab notebooks for experimenting with different guardrail frameworks used in securing and controlling Large Language Models (LLMs).
It covers hands-on tutorials, code samples, and comparison experiments across three widely discussed frameworks:
	•	NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails
	•	Llama Guard (Meta’s safety classifier)
	•	Guardrails AI
🛠️ Frameworks Covered

1. NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails
	•	Rule-based + ML-driven framework for enforcing safety, security, and compliance.
	•	Supports flow definition files (Colang) for conversational control.
	•	Integration with multiple LLM providers.
	•	Example use cases: content filtering, data redaction, safety checks.

⸻

2. Llama Guard
	•	Lightweight guardrail model released by Meta.
	•	Functions as a safety classifier that detects policy-violating generations.
	•	Can be used as a filter alongside other LLMs.
	•	Example use cases: toxicity detection, harmful instruction blocking.

⸻

3. Guardrails AI
	•	Open-source Python library for specifying, validating, and enforcing constraints on LLM outputs.
	•	Schema-driven approach with pydantic-like validators.
	•	Strong focus on structured outputs (JSON/XML/YAML) and semantic validation.
	•	Example use cases: ensuring responses follow format, preventing hallucinations.
